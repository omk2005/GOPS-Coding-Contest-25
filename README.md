Game of Pure Strategy:
We created a function that returns a card that best guarantees a victory based on the situation.
int playCard(int a[14], int b[14], int flippedCard, int currentPot)
    where a denotes the array of cards that we have
          b denotes the array of cards that the opponent has
          flippedCard is the card in front of us and the opponent
          currentPot denotes the pot (points at stake for the current play)
